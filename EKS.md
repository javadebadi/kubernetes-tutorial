# EKS
Amazon has managed a Kubernetes service called **Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)**. EKS is a managed service and you don't have access to control plane nodes, but you have access to your worker nodes and you can deploy your pods in EKS.
In this tutorial, we show you how to use EKS to create a cluster and deploy your applications.
